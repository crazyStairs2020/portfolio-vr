    For this project, the assignment was to select a webpage with
    a design that was lacking in Usability, Learnability, and
    Memorability. After analyzing the site and coming up with
    improvements, the next step was to redesign the page and
    implement solutions to the problems found

  <h2>Website Selected</h2>

  <pre><span style="font-size: 30px">
    I chose to work on the Providence RI home page since it is
    presenting content that I am very familiar with and will
    have an easy time coming up with ideas for. Also, I wanted
    to consider upgrades to this site since it is very text
    heavy and could better present the material with a different layout.

  After analyzing the home page for the site, I took
  the following notes based on the above criteria
</pre>
    </span>


    <pre> <span style="font-size: 25px">
<h4>  Usability</h4>
  •	Language change option is a small button and easy to miss.
        Also there is only English text for the “Select Language”
        option as well as the different languages listed

  •	Links that lead to completing actions are listed in small text
        and hard to see. 

  •	Organization of functions is not clearly laid out since there
        is a top requests menu but for other functions the
        viewers have to scroll past the news updates section. 

  •	The main tabs along the top only have a drop down for some items. 
</pre>
    </span>



    <pre> <span style="font-size: 25px">
  <h4>  Learnability</h4>
  •	The main issue with the learnability of this page is that although
        there are many options laid out, it is not clear what the
        sites main purpose is. 

  •	If a user were unclear whether or not this site contained the resources
        for what they were trying to do, it could be difficult to search
        through all the options before determining whether or not this
        site has what was needed
</pre>
    </span>

    <pre> <span style="font-size: 25px">
  <h4>  Memorability</h4>
  •	The home page provides links to start many different processes. The layout
        of these is a little confusing since the tabs along the top seem
        comprehensive yet there are additional options on the side in the
        Top Requests menu. Below the news updates there are also many more
        options in regards to viewing various records and data. Since each
        of these buttons leads to many more options and a long user journey,
        it could be easy to forget the path when coming back to recall something
        that was found

  •	An issue with the Top Requests menu is that it is most likely dynamic. If a
        user were to find their option from this menu and then return to the
        site at a later date, it could be difficult to recall if it were no
        longer in the menu where the user is now used to seeing it.
        


  The next step was to leverage the WAVE application to evaluate this site on
  an accessibility criteria. Below is a summary of findings 

  -Low contrasting text
  -Dual links in header
  -Device dependent event handler 
  -Small text for Change Language  
</pre>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div class="persona-container">
    <img src="lowContrast.png" height="400" width="600">
    <img src="redundentLinks.png" height="400" width="600">

  </div>
  <pre> <span style="font-size: 25px">


  After using the WAVE application, I saw that it detected the issue of small text
  on the Select Language option that I had noted initially. This tool also highlighted
  several occurrences of low contrast text that I had not noticed when initially reviewing.


  Along with these issues in the text, WAVE also highlighted technical issues of redundant
  links and device dependent handlers which I had not done any high level testing for when
  completing my initial review. Using WAVE was a helpful tool in confirming ideas I had
  initially as well as getting new ideas on things I failed to notice the first time around.

      Due to the complex nature of the site layout,
      I quickly found that it was out of scope to 
      completely remodel every detail. However since
      I still wanted to present my ideas and design 
      the improvements I chose to stick with this 
      page and emphasise the changes over the general 
      layout in place.
      
      Despite this page being a truncated model of the 
      orginal home page, it does include all the upgrades 
      I had chosen to implement.
